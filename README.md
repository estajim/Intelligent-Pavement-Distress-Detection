# Intelligent-Pavement-Distress-Detection
This Repo includes my works in detection of standardized pavement distresses and all the neccasary branches as I am working on it. In this independent project, I intend to enhance automated crack/distress detection tasks in my company. We have ample of manually annotated images with labels of distress types. I am planning to build Convolutional Neural Networks on such datasets to automatically detect arial cracks such as alligator cracking, block cracking, patches, etc. Therefore, this is an object detection tasks. To start, The TnesorFlow's object detector API will be used (Described in https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-your-own-object-detector-ad69dda69c85) I will share more as I progress further.
